# Pomodoro

This is a Pomodoro timer application built using Python and Tkinter.

## Description

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. This project is a simple implementation of a Pomodoro timer.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

You can start the Pomodoro timer by running the `main.py` file. The timer will start with a work session of 25 minutes followed by a short break of 5 minutes. After four work sessions, a long break of 20 minutes will occur.

```bash
python main.py
```
